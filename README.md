# PDF Text Extraction and Summarization Pipeline

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to extract, process, and summarize text from PDF documents using a combination of Python libraries and transformer-based models.

## Overview

This notebook is designed to automate the process of extracting text from PDFs, cleaning and preprocessing the text, and applying state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) models to generate summaries and other insights from the text.

### Key Features
- **PDF Text Extraction**: Extracts text from PDF files using `PyPDF2` and `pdfplumber`.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Utilizes `nltk` for tokenizing and cleaning the extracted text.
- **Text Summarization**: Uses a transformer-based model from the `transformers` library to summarize long passages of text.
- **Result Output**: Displays summaries and other processed results in a readable format.

## Installation

To run this notebook, ensure that you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them via `pip` using the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Libraries:
- `PyPDF2`
- `nltk`
- `sentence-transformers`
- `fpdf`
- `transformers`
- `pdfplumber`

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook notebook_name.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Load your PDF file.
   - Preprocess the text.
   - Generate summaries or other text-based analyses.

## How It Works

The notebook is divided into the following sections:
1. **Library Installation**: Installs all required libraries for the pipeline.
2. **Text Extraction**: Extracts text from a PDF file using `pdfplumber`.
3. **Text Preprocessing**: Prepares the text for summarization, including tokenization and cleaning.
4. **Summarization**: Utilizes a pre-trained transformer model for generating summaries of the text.
5. **Results**: Outputs the results, including the generated summaries or other relevant insights.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how the pipeline works:
1. Load a PDF file.
2. Extract the text.
3. Process the text for summarization.
4. Output the summary.

```python
summarizer = pipeline("summarization")
summary = summarizer(text, max_length=130, min_length=30, do_sample=False)
print(summary)
```
